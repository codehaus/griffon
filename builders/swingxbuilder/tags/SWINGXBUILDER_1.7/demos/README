The demos:

30BoxesViewer --- A demo showing CollapsiblePanes and a simple API built by using SwingX-WS calls
		[This one might break due to changes to 30Boxes's REST API]
CalendarDemo  --- A port of a Glossitope widget showing a view of the month and the current day
PainterDemo   --- A port of the demo orginally done by Romain Guy
