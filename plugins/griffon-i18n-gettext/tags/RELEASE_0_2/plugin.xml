  <title>I18n gettext plugin for griffon</title>
  <description>Based on the grails plugin i18n-gettext by Rainer Brang, Backend-Server GmbH &amp; Co. KG.
    
This plugin adds i18n support to your app, in 'gnu gettext'-style.
1 First, you need to wrap special tags or service calls around all strings you want to translate.
2 Then you call "griffon i18n-gettext" to extract all translatable strings from your sources.
3 Now you translate all strings from step 2 which you will find in .po files in your i18n directory.
4 Call "griffon i18n-gettext makemo" to compile your translated .po files into resource classes.
5 repeat 1-4 each time you added some new strings to your application. Existing translations will be merged in. 

During runtime: The methods, you wrapped around the strings, will pick the correct translation according to the
current locale, and return the translated string. You may also force a locale for a specific call.

What you need: The developer needs these command line tools for the development machine: xgettext, msgmerge and msgfmt
The translator may like: PoEdit or alike to translate texts.

You will love the dead simple plural form handling and FormatMessage-like String handling. Additionally, you can 
forget about inventing lookup keys for your .properties files, because for gnu gettext, the original string is the key.
Plus: No more problems with special chars like german umlauts. gettext can handle that.

You can exclude directories from being scanned for translatable strings in your Config.groovy file.

Beware: 
a) Gnu gettext can not handle groovy's "here-doc" strings, so don't try to wrap tr() or alike around them. Also some
xgettext binaries seem to dislike here-doc strings so much, they don't parse files containing here-doc files correctly.
b) Your original strings should be english, because Gnu gettext can't cope with non-ascii characters as original strings.
