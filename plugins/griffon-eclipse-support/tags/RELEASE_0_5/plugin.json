At the moment there is a single\nscript that keeps Eclipse's classpath file up to date.\n\nUsage\n-----\nThis plugin provides a single script which is automatically called whenever a plugin\nis installed or uninstalled. If you add/remove a library from $appHome/lib then you\nmust manually run the script.\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\nMake sure to define the following classpath variables in your Eclipse environment\n\n * **USER_HOME** pointing to `$USER_HOME` (your user's home directory)\n * **GRIFFON_HOME** pointing to `$GRIFFON_HOME` (the location where Griffon is installed)\n\notherwise Eclipse will complain that the jars cannot be located.\n\nAll source directories available under `griffon-app` and `src` will be automatically\nconfigured by the plugin. However, should you require additional source directories\nto be included you can do so by specifying a list of directories relative to the\napplication's location. Add this settings to either `BuildConfig.groovy` or `settings.groovy`\n\n        eclipse.classpath.include = ['gen-src', '../app2/src']\n\nScripts\n-------\n * **eclipse-update** - re-generates the contents of the .classpath file.","authors":[{"name":"Andres Almiray","email":"aalmiray@yahoo.com"}],"dependencies":[],"toolkits":[],"platforms":[]}
